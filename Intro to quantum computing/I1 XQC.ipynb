    "# I.1 All about qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "All modern classical computation is done using binary digits, or bits. Instead of regular bits, which take one of two values (0 or 1), quantum computing uses qubits. Qubits are physical systems that, just like bits, can exist in a \"0\" state and a \"1\" state. For now, you can think of these two states like the two sides of a coin, \"heads\" or \"tails\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the state of a qubit is written as a complex-valued vector with two elements. These vectors, or \"state vectors\", are denoted by the symbol $|\\cdot \\rangle\\$ , which is called a ket (this is known as Dirac notation). The qubit's \"0\" and \"1\" states are expressed as follows: $$|0 \\rangle\\=\\binom{1}{0}\\quad |1 \\rangle\\=\\binom{0}{1} $$\n",
    "The element sitting within the  is the label for that state. These two vectors might look familiar; they look just like the two basis vectors you would use for drawing vectors on a 2-dimensional plane. In fact, these two states form a basis for single-qubit states called the computational basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of this mathematical description, unlike a bit, a qubit is not limited to being in one of these two states. Qubits can exist in what's known as a superposition of states. A superposition is a linear combination of two basis vectors. Mathematically, $$|\\Psi \\rangle=\\alpha|0 \\rangle+\\beta|1 \\rangle=\\alpha\\binom{1}{0}+\\beta\\binom{0}{1}=\\binom{\\alpha}{\\beta}$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers. \\alpha and \\beta are called amplitudes, and for a state to be valid they must be chosen carefully to satisfy the following criteria:$$|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=\\alpha\\alpha^{*}+\\beta\\beta^{*}=1$$ where $\\alpha^{*}$ and $\\beta^{*}$ are the complex conjugates. When $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ satisfy this property, a quantum state is called normalized. When a qubit is in a superposition, it is not in both $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ \"simultaneously\", but is rather in some intermediate combination of the two. If you consider again the analogy of a coin, if $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$are \"heads\" and \"tails\", a superposition would be like a coin spinning on its edge.\n"

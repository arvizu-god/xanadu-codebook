Quite often, we would like our qubits to start in state $|0\\rangle$ (which is the default in PennyLane), however there are many cases where we instead would like to start from $|1\\rangle$. Complete the function below by using qml.PauliX to initialize the qubit's state to $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ based on an input flag. Then, use qml.QubitUnitary to apply the provided U."

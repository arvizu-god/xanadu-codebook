    "Now that you've run your very first quantum algorithm, you might be wondering whether there's a cleaner way of representing things than vectors and matrix multiplication. In the next few exercises, we'll abstract away the linear algebra, and explore how to use PennyLane to implement quantum algorithms. In tandem, you'll start playing with quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits are a common means of visually representing the sequence of operations that are performed on qubits during a quantum computation. They consist of a set of operations, or gates, applied to a set of qubits (or more generally, wires). Each wire in the diagram represents a qubit. Circuits are read from left to right, and this is the order in which operations are applied. Quantum circuits end in a measurement of one or more qubits. For example, the circuit below has 3 qubits that start in state $|0\\rangle$, applies 5 operations, and measures every qubit at the end.\n",

    "In PennyLane, a quantum circuit is represented by a quantum function. These are just regular Python functions, with some special properties: they must apply one or more quantum operations, and return one or more quantum measurements. Expressing quantum circuits as quantum functions allows us to represent circuits compactly, and use regular programming concepts such as subroutines (subcircuits), loops, and input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we would like to write a circuit for 2 qubits. By default in PennyLane, qubits (wires) are ordered numerically starting from 0 (which corresponds to the top qubit in the circuit). In pseudocode, a quantum function looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pennylane as qml\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_quantum_function(params):\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Single-qubit operations with no input parameters\n",
    "    qml.Gate1(wires=0)\n",
    "    qml.Gate2(wires=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # A single-qubit operation with an input parameter\n",
    "    qml.Gate3(params[0], wires=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Two-qubit operation with no input parameter on wires 0 and 1\n",
    "    qml.TwoQubitGate1(wires=[0, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Two-qubit operation with an input parameter on wires 0 and 1\n",
    "    qml.TwoQubitGate2(params[1], wires=[0, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Return the result of a measurement\n",
    "    return qml.Measurement(wires=[0, 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how operations on qubits are applied one per line. Each operation indicates which qubits it acts on, and some operations also take input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip. PennyLane uses the term wires rather than qubits because it also supports continuous-variable quantum computing, for which a wire in a circuit does not correspond to a qubit."
